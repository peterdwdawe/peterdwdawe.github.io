# Hello! 

I'm Peter, a software developer based in Newfoundland, Canada. Although my educational background is in mechanical engineering, I've been working in software since 2016. My work during that time has been mostly focused on rendering and game development in Unity. Check out the projects below to see a sample of what I've been working on!

## Projects
### Dither Master
**DEMO IMAGES/VIDEOS HERE**

**Dither Master** is a tools suite and post-processing effect for Unity that adds a retro, pixelated feel to your game. Use the built-in hardware emulation palettes, or create your own custom palette of up to 256 colors to dial in a unique mood. Lightweight and easy to use, Dither Master is compatible with all three render pipelines, and integrates seamlessly into your existing post-processing stack. 

**Available on the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/335534) now!**

*Source code is also available for free under a non-commercial license on [GitHub](https://github.com/peterdwdawe/unity-palette-asset).*

**Tidal Shock: Off The Hook** is a wet and wild PvP shooter for 2-12 players! Hunt down foes on high-speed torpedoes, Outmaneuver rivals with 360Â° tactics, and master 4 high-stakes game modes in sprawling underwater arenas. Always free to play, never pay to win! First released into early access in 2020, and later as a full release in 2025, Tidal Shock is available on Steam for Windows and Linux.

As lead developer at Moonray Studios, I was responsible for implementing every functional system in Tidal Shock, including gameplay, networking, rendering, UI, optimization, and localization.

**Check it out on Steam!**

### Escape!VR
**DEMO IMAGES/VIDEOS HERE**

[**Escape!VR**](https://www.meta.com/experiences/escapevr/1252228518185805) is a VR escape room game, and was my first foray into game development while I was still in university. Originally developed in Unity 5.4 for the Samsung Gear VR, and later ported to the Oculus Go, it was released in 2016, with follow-up DLC released in 2018. 

As Co-Founder & Lead Developer at New Island Studios, I wrote the entire codebase for Escape!VR, as well as designing levels and writing and producing all music & sound effects.

It's no longer for sale, but the [store page looks like it's still being preserved](https://www.meta.com/experiences/escapevr/1252228518185805) *(for now)*.
