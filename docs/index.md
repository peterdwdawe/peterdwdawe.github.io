## Dither Master
**DEMO IMAGES/VIDEOS HERE**

**Dither Master** is a tools suite and post-processing effect for Unity that adds a retro, pixelated feel to your game. Use the built-in hardware emulation palettes, or create your own custom palette of up to 256 colors to dial in a unique mood. Lightweight and easy to use, Dither Master is compatible with all three render pipelines, and integrates seamlessly into your existing post-processing stack. 

**Available on the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/335534) now!**

*Source code is also available for non-commercial use on [GitHub](https://github.com/peterdwdawe/unity-palette-asset).*

**Tidal Shock: Off The Hook** is a wet and wild PvP shooter for 2-12 players! Hunt down foes on high-speed torpedoes, Outmaneuver rivals with 360Â° tactics, and master 4 high-stakes game modes in sprawling underwater arenas. Always free to play, never pay to win!

As lead developer at Moonray Studios, I was responsible for implementing every functional system in Tidal Shock, including gameplay, networking, rendering, UI, optimization, and localization.

## Escape!VR
**DEMO IMAGES/VIDEOS HERE**

[**Escape!VR**](https://www.meta.com/experiences/escapevr/1252228518185805) is a VR escape room game, and was my first foray into game development while I was still in university. Originally developed in Unity 5.4 for the Samsung Gear VR, and later ported to the Oculus Go, it was released in 2016, with follow-up DLC released in 2018. 

As Co-Founder & Lead Developer at New Island Studios, I wrote the entire codebase for Escape!VR, as well as designing levels and writing and producing all music & sound effects.

Escape!VR is no longer available for purchase, but it looks like Meta is still preserving the old [store page](https://www.meta.com/experiences/escapevr/1252228518185805) *(for now)*.
